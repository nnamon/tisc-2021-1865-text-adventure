Running from the twins now, you burst into a clearing of flowers. The twins forlornly stare after
you, unable to pass. Their voices fade in the distance as they attempt to finish their poem.

All around you are extremely large flowers, with faces almost. Sad flowers. You notice some shredded
petals sitting all around you on the ground arranged in a symmetrical pattern, almost like...
wordplay.

They whisper to you madly, "The talkative one came through here, yes. Talked about pleasant talks,
pleasant walks, and pleasant parties, yes. The Mouse has an invitation, yes. The talkative one does
not, no. They will trap him forever, yes."
